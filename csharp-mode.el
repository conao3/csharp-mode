;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This is a major mode for editing C# code.  It performs automatic
;;    indentation of C# syntax; font locking; and integration with
;;    imenu.el.
;;
;;    csharp-mode requires CC Mode 5.30 or later.  It works with
;;    cc-mode 5.31.3, which is current at this time.
;;
;; Features:
;;
;;   - font-lock and indent of C# syntax including:
;;       all c# keywords and major syntax
;;       attributes that decorate methods, classes, fields, properties
;;       enum types
;;       #if/#endif  #region/#endregion
;;       instance initializers
;;       anonymous functions and methods
;;       verbatim literal strings (those that begin with @)
;;       generics
;;
;;   - automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.
;;
;;   - compatible with electric-pair-mode for intelligent insertion
;;     of matched braces, quotes, etc.
;;
;;   - imenu integration - generates an index of namespaces, classes,
;;     interfaces, methods, and properties for easy navigation within
;;     the buffer.
;;

;;  General
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  Mostly C# mode will "just work."  Use `describe-mode' to see the
;;  default keybindings and the highlights of the mode.
;;
;;
;;  imenu integration
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This should just work.  For those who don't know what imenu is, it
;;  allows navigation to different points within the file from an
;;  "Index" menu, in the window's menubar.  csharp-mode computes the
;;  menu containing the namespaces, classes, methods, and so on, in the
;;  buffer.  This happens at the time the file is loaded; for large
;;  files it takes a bit of time to complete the scan.  If you don't
;;  want this capability, set `csharp-want-imenu' to nil.
;;
;;


;;; Known Bugs:
;;
;;   The imenu scan is text-based and naive. For example, if you
;;   intersperse comments between the name of a class/method/namespace,
;;   and the curly brace, the scan will not recognize the thing being
;;   declared. This is fixable - would need to extract the buffer
;;   substring then remove comments before doing the regexp checks - but
;;   it would make the scan much slower.  Also, the scan doesn't deal
;;   with preproc symbol definitions and #if/#else. Those things are
;;   invisible to the scanner csharp-mode uses to build the imenu menu.
;;
;;   Leading identifiers are no longer being fontified, for some reason.
;;   See matchers-before. (Not sure this is still a problem - 19 may
;;   2011 DPC)
;;
;;   Method names with a preceding attribute are not fontified.
;;
;;   The symbol following #if is not fontified.  It should be treated like
;;   define and get font-lock-variable-name-face .
;;
;;   This code doesn't seem to work when you compile it, then
;;   load/require in the emacs file. You will get an error (error
;;   "`c-lang-defconst' must be used in a file") which happens because
;;   cc-mode doesn't think it is in a buffer while loading directly
;;   from the init. However, if you call it based on a file extension,
;;   it works properly. Interestingly enough, this doesn't happen if
;;   you don't byte-compile cc-mode.
;;
;;
;;
;;  Todo:
;;
;;   imenu should scan for and find delegates and events, in addition
;;   to the classes, structs, properties and methods it does currently.
;;
;;   Get csharp-mode.el accepted as part of the emacs standard distribution.
;;   Must contact monnier at iro.umontreal.ca to make this happen.
;;

;;    and making suggestions. And to Trey Jackson for sharing his
;;    knowledge of emacs lisp.

;;; Versions:
;;
;;    0.1.0 - Initial release.
;;    0.2.0 - Fixed the identification on the "enum" keyword.
;;          - Fixed the font-lock on the "base" keyword
;;    0.3.0 - Added a regex to fontify attributes. It isn't the
;;            the best method, but it handles single-like attributes
;;            well.
;;          - Got "super" not to fontify as a keyword.
;;          - Got extending classes and interfaces to fontify as something.
;;    0.4.0 - Removed the attribute matching because it broke more than
;;            it fixed.
;;          - Corrected a bug with namespace not being properly identified
;;            and treating the class level as an inner object, which screwed
;;            up formatting.
;;          - Added "partial" to the keywords.
;;    0.5.0 - Found bugs with compiled cc-mode and loading from init files.
;;          - Updated the eval-when-compile to code to let the mode be
;;            compiled.
;;    0.6.0 - Added the c-filter-ops patch for 5.31.1 which made that
;;            function in cc-langs.el unavailable.
;;          - Added a csharp-lineup-region for indentation #region and
;;            #endregion block differently.
;;    0.7.0 - Added autoload so update-directory-autoloads works
;;            (Thank you, Nikolaj Schumacher)
;;          - Fontified the entire #region and #endregion lines.
;;          - Initial work to get get, set, add, remove font-locked.
;;    0.7.1 - Added option to indent #if/endif with code
;;          - Fixed c-opt-cpp-prefix defn (it must not include the BOL
;;            char (^).
;;          - proper fontification and indent of classes that inherit
;;            (previously the colon was confusing the parser)
;;          - reclassified namespace as a block beginner
;;          - removed $ as a legal symbol char - not legal in C#.
;;          - added struct to c-class-decl-kwds so indent is correct
;;            within a struct.
;;    0.7.2 - Added automatic codedoc insertion.
;;    0.7.3 - Instance initializers (new Type { ... } ) and
;;            (new Type() { ...} ) are now indented properly.
;;          - proper fontification and indent of enums as brace-list-*,
;;            including special treatment for enums that explicitly
;;            inherit from an int type. Previously the colon was
;;            confusing the parser.
;;          - proper fontification of verbatim literal strings,
;;            including those that end in slash. This edge case was not
;;            handled at all before; it is now handled correctly.
;;          - code cleanup and organization; removed the formfeed.
;;          - intelligent curly-brace insertion with
;;            `csharp-insert-open-brace'
;;    0.7.4 - added a C# style
;;          - using is now a keyword and gets fontified correctly
;;          - fixed a bug that had crept into the codedoc insertion.
;;    0.7.5 - now fontify namespaces in the using statements. This is
;;            done in the csharp value for c-basic-matchers-before .
;;          - also fontify the name following namespace decl.
;;            This is done in the csharp value for c-basic-matchers-after .
;;          - turn on recognition of generic types. They are now
;;            fontified correctly.
;;          - <> are now treated as syntactic parens and can be jumped
;;            over with c-forward-sexp.
;;          - Constructors are now fontified.
;;          - Field/Prop names inside object initializers are now fontified.
;;
;;    0.7.7 - relocate running c-run-mode-hooks to the end of
;;            csharp-mode, to allow user to modify key bindings in a
;;            hook if he doesn't like the defaults.
;;
;;    0.7.8 - redefine csharp-log to insert timestamp.
;;          - Fix byte-compile errors on emacs 23.2 ?  Why was
;;            c-filter-ops duplicated here?  What was the purpose of its
;;            presence here, I am not clear.
;;
;;    0.8.0 - include flymake magic into this module.
;;          - include yasnippet integration
;;
;;    0.8.2 2011 April DPC
;;          - small tweaks; now set a one-time bool for flymake installation
;;          - some doc updates on flymake
;;
;;    0.8.3 2011 May 17  DPC
;;          - better help on csharp-mode
;;          - csharp-move-* functions for manual navigation.
;;          - imenu integration for menu-driven navigation - navigate to
;;            named methods, classes, etc.
;;          - adjusted the flymake regexp to handle output from fxcopcmd,
;;            and extended the help to provide examples how to use this.
;;
;;    0.8.4 DPC 2011 May 18
;;          - fix a basic bug in the `csharp-yasnippet-fixup' fn.
;;
;;    0.8.5 DPC 2011 May 21
;;          - imenu: correctly parse Properties that are part of an
;;            explicitly specified interface. Probably need to do this
;;            for methods, too.
;;          - fontify the optional alias before namespace in a using (import).
;;          - Tweak open-curly magic insertion for object initializers.
;;          - better fontification of variables and references
;;          - "sealed" is now fontified as a keyword
;;          - imenu: correctly index ctors that call this or base.
;;          - imenu: correctly index Extension methods (this System.Enum e)
;;          - imenu: correctly scan  method params tagged with out, ref, params
;;          - imenu scan: now handle curlies within strings.
